Warning: perls non-standard './Configure' script was not written to be portable.
         It is unknown whether to work with non-standard shells or coreutils.
         If problems encountered, report via git issue.

Warning: Do not try to build perl as part of stage0, its script tries to pull
         in too many pieces from the host system rendering the final build
         unreliable. Build perl during stage1 as suggested.

Notice: Man pages are removed during postbuild(). They are a massive ~20MB and
        frankly I don't think are often read. Comment out this section in
        postbuild() if you absolutely need them.
