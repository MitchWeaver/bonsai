    #       sbase's sed is not built with the non-posix but
    #       *very* handy flag 'sed -i'.
    #
    #       obase's sed is bugged, gets stuck in loops on large regex strings
    #
    #       For now we'll have to settle with using GNU sed...
    #       We'll use sbase's sed to build GNU sed.
