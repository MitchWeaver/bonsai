    # GNU programs have the most insane dependency tracking I have ever seen.
    # To check for dependencies, they often simply try to run the program
    # and if it has a -gt 0 exit code, the dependency must not be in $PATH.
    #
    # This breaks all kinds of things, namely if we are running under `set -e`
    # As a workaround, just manually track depedencies -- clear the file.

    # Configure scripts often try to run programs with certain flags
    # to see if they support different things.
    # They often don't even use those flags in the end...
    # Usually to avoid these checks all you need to is have their name
    # in the environment in all caps like so:
    : ${GREP:=grep} ${SED:=sed} ${AWK:=awk} ${TAR:=tar} ${FIND:=find}
