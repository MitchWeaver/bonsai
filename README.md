# bonsai

<img align="right" src="https://bonsai-linux.org/res/logo.png">

A tiny Linux distribution based on musl-libc focused on simplicity and correctness.

Linux done differently.

For the idealists, for the hobbyists.

### Achtung!
Bonsai is a hobby distro; a love affair.  
It is still in active, early development.  
There are bugs. There are snakes.

### Thanks
